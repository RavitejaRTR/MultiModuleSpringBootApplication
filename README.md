# MultiModuleSpringBootApplication
Multi module Spring Boot application 

1. gradlew is very useful in easily building and starting your application.
   (Used 'gradle wrapper --gradle-version 6.5' to initialize gradlew in this repo)
   
2. This project uses Kotlin DSL in place of regular Groovy DSL for build scripts.

3. This project follows annotation driven configuration instead of xml based configuration definition.
